  Hi, this is Angelica. Due to my limited coding abilities, I have some instructions I will need you to follow.
  When you click on the button below, it will take you to my final work. Once there,
  </div>
    <br>
  <div id="introtext2">
  please hit 'play' on every single video before you begin engaging with the work as a whole.
  </div>
    <br>
  <div id="introtext3">
  I wanted all the videos to be on autoplay but I couldn't get it to work. Play the video simply by clicking anywhere on it.
  </div>
  <br>
  <div id="introtext4">
  In addition, for the most ideal viewing of this work, please view it on a computer screen on <u>FULL-SCREEN MODE</u>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
  After some time has elapsed, you may:
    <br/>
    <br/>
  (1) try taking a CLOSER LOOK at each video by clicking on the <u>'full-screen' icon</u> found at the <u>bottom right-hand corner</u> of each video, and
    <br/>
    <br/>
  (2) try controlling the audio and muting certain videos while playing others.
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div id="introtext6">
  Have fun, enjoy and thank you!
